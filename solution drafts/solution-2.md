# Solution 2: "SAFE"

## Concept Summary

 * Solution developed by the "SAFE project"

## Solution description

The SAFE consortium aims to create a transperancy software system architecture and to defines interfaces and data formats.

One promising concept is, that the user can check his bill via the transperancy software and also the CPO and MO can or will check the meter values. The public database will be the BNetzA and the use of QR codes for better user comfort.

More informations on the concept is needed.

## Requirement fulfillment

The legal requirements:

| Requirement 	| Fulfillment |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Precision 	| ? |
| Authenticity 	| ? |
| Integrity 	| ? |
| Imputability 	| ? |
| Availability 	| ? |

The project goals:

| Goal 		| Fulfillment |
|:--------------|:------------|
| User friendly 		| ? |
| Open source 			| planned |
| Protocol compatibility 	| ? |
| Roaming-ready 		| ? |


### Legal Requirements

#### 1. Precision

Unknown.


#### 2. Authenticity

The meter values will be signed, so the data source is assignable.


#### 3. Integrity

The signature check in the transparency software will detect any meter value changes.


#### 4. Imputability

The signed meter values will include informations about the data source.


#### 5. Availability

Unknown. The meter value storage is not declared.


### Project Goals

#### 1. User friendly

The user can check the meter values with the transperancy software. Depends on the software and conceptual design.


#### 2. Open source

Planned. So far there is no public available repository known so far.


#### 3. Compatible with existing protocols

Not enough information available.


#### 4. Roaming-ready
 
Not enough information available.
